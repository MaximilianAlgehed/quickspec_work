-- Equations that would be cool to work with from APL --

    Property ← {∧/⍵ = ⍳⌈/⍵ ⍳ ⍵}

    This would be:
    "The list of the indecies of every
    number from 1 to ⌈⍵ in ⍵ 
    is equal to ⍵"
    This is of course only true for lists with no negative
    numbers. Here is the conditional:

    Condition ← {∧/1≤⍵}
    Impl ← {⍵∨(~⍺)}
    CondProperty ← {(Condition ⍵) Impl (Property ⍵)}

    We can very easily write this as a property test 
    in apl using the ? function and some magic
