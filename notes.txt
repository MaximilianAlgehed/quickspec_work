    Automatic Induction inside Superposition

-- Pros and cons of different methods for encoding constraints --

    ~Two possible methods:

        ~Function encoding: (FE)

            Make a function that converts data to a format where a predicate always holds
            
            Questions:

                What does this approach really mean?

            Possible problems:
                Adding more functions that work over the same type as the rest of the program

                The problem is that adding max and min to describe the relationship (x >= y)
                means that we end up with a theory for max and min

            How would we express "x Greater than y and y positive" in FE?

        ~Type encoding: (TE)

            Create types that are instantiated such that the predicate always holds

            Positive result:
                Giving quickcheck the insert (as in insertion sort) function, a type for 
                generating a pair of numbers (x, y) where x > y, and the basic list implementation
                (nil and cons) generates this rather exciting output in almost no time:

                    insert i [] = i:[]
                    insert x (y:is) = y:(insert x is)
                    insert y (x:is) = y:x:is

            Possible problems:
                Complex relationships involving the same variable can be hard to encode

            Question to investigate:
                If we have the type Greater and the type Pos, how do we express:
                    x Greater than y and y Pos ?

                    Figuring this out would allow quickspec to find like:
                    x > y && y > 0 => x > 1


         ~Comparison of Type encoding and Function encoding:

            In Type encoding (TE) we introduce a new type and a function which simply lifts from that type.
            In Function encoding (FE) we introduce a function which works on the same type as the rest of the
            theory. A problem I have encountered when not using any background theory etc is that TE is able to
            handle a maxTermSize of 10 for smaller theories without problem. However FE fails at size 10 when doing something
            as simple as encoding (x >= y) using max and min. The reason for this seems to be that quickspec
            is busy generating the theory for max and min when we are not really interested in that theory.

         ~Problems with these methods:
            
            They introduce overhead, quite alot of overhead
