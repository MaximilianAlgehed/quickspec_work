-- Equations that would be cool to work with from APL --

    +: List indexing
        Property ← {∧/⍵ = ⍳⌈/⍵ ⍳ ⍵}

        This would be:
        "The list of the indecies of every
        number in ⍵ in the list of numbers
        from 1 to max(⍵) 
        is equal to ⍵"
        This is of course only true for lists with no negative
        numbers. Here is the conditional:

        Condition ← {∧/1≤⍵}
        Impl ← {⍵∨(~⍺)}
        CondProperty ← {(Condition ⍵) Impl (Property ⍵)}

        We can very easily write this as a property test 
        in apl using the ? function and some magic


    +: Subsets
        Property ← {∧/⍵∊⍺[(⍺∊⍵)/⍳⍴⍺]}

        "
        List Property Data
        "
    
        Says that "Every value in Data is also in
        the list comprised of the values at the 
        indecies of items in List that are also
        in data"

        However, if Data contains elements not in
        List then those elements can not be accessed
        by any indexing (⍺[...]) of List.

        So the conditional would be:

        Conditional ← {∧/⍵∊⍺}

        So

        "
        List Conditional Data
        "

        is

        "List is a superset of Data"
