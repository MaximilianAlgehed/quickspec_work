     *: Have done since last meeting

        ~ Q-types, conjunction in TE - Algorithm for faster generation

        ~ T-types, transforms in TE

        ~ Examples for why naive transforms don't work in FE

        ~ Tried to work with TIP problems and emna - not much success

        ~ Difficult to find solid examples of where we can utilize conditional equations in Hipspec.

        ~ It has been difficult to translate results from QuickSpec into emna because of lack of invariants (unlike QS)

        ~ Many "results" in QS are non-results in emna, as emna tends to prove the "target" without needing the conditionals
        ~ Example of this in the NilHead.hs in TIP example

     *: Want to do before writing everything up

        ~ Do large scale experiments to inform my writing

        ~ Conjunction in FE - hard to say something about TE being better when we don't have
        ~ even a solid propsal to solve this problem

        ~ Conjunction in CE, requires us to have solved conjunction in FE first

        ~ Mathematics for soundness

        ~ Mathematics for efficiency

        ~ Explore CE some more
