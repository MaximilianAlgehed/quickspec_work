-- Talking points for meeting 16-01-18 --

     *: Have done since last meeting

        ~ Automatic generation of TE

        ~ Automatic generation of FE

        ~ Different metrics for measuring how good FE and TE are

        ~ Soundness issues in FE lead to CE

        ~ Q-types, conjunction in TE

        ~ T-types, transforms in TE

        ~ Examples for why naive transforms don't work in FE

        ~ Written about methodology

        ~ Nick's ideas about toP functions and how we can avoid them

     *: Want to do before writing everything up

        ~ Do large scale experiments to inform my writing

        ~ Conjunction in FE

        ~ Conjunction in CE, requires us to have solved conjunction in FE first

        ~ Mathematics for soundness

        ~ Mathematics for efficiency

        ~ Explore CE some more

        ~ Do a case study of some sort

     *: Goal

        ~ Write everything up as a paper that can be published

        ~ Topic of the paper would be comparison of the three (two ?) methods

     *: Future work

        ~ Work on algorithms for optimal order of generation of random data, it's definately a graph problem (?)

        ~ EDSL or QDSL for order of generation issue in TE, EDSL vs. QDSL it's own problem

        ~ Implement everything as a system that uses FE, CE, and TE when appropriet in QuickSpec
