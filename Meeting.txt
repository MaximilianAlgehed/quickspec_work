     *: Have done since last meeting

        (y = y1) && x < y && y1 < z => ...

        ~ Q-types, conjunction in TE - Algorithm for faster generation

        ~ T-types, transforms in TE

        ~ Examples for why naive transforms don't work in FE

        ~ Difficult to find solid examples of where we can utilize conditional equations in Hipspec. 
        //Maybe my fault?

        ~ Many "results" in QS are non-results in emna, as emna tends to prove the "target" without needing the conditionals
        ~ Example of this in the NilHead.hs in TIP example

     *: Want to do before writing everything up

        ~ Conjunction in FE - hard to say something about TE being better when we don't have
        ~ even a solid propsal to solve this problem

        ~ Conjunction in CE, requires us to have solved conjunction in FE first (?)

        ~ Mathematics for soundness

        ~ Mathematics for efficiency

        ~ Prove the correctness and usefullness of the algorithm for Q-types

        ~ Explore CE some more
