\section{Future work}
We plan to use the work of Claessen et. al. \cite{Claessen2014generating}
to develop more efficient random
generators for type encodings.

Furthermore we also plan to use the
results from that and related work to
help improve the efficiency
of conjunctions of predicates.
There are several possible algorithms for
ordering term generation when working with
conjunctions and we hope to investigate the
differences between various solutions.

Other plans are to find an algorithm to deal
with possibly injective functions in predicates.
