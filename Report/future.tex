\section{Future work}
We plan to use the work of Claessen et. al.
\cite{Claessen2014generating} and
Dureg√•rd \cite{Duregard}
to develop more efficient random
generators for type encodings.
We have a concrete plan for how to do 
so which we will present here.
We can use functional enumeration
to generate a stream of constrained
data. The \texttt{sized} function from
QuickCheck would then let us
take any item from index $0$ to $size-1$
of this stream and use it as our arbitrary
data. One problem with this technique is
that it is limited to algebraic datatypes.

Furthermore we also plan to use the
results from that and related work to
help improve the efficiency
of conjunctions of predicates.
There are several possible algorithms for
ordering term generation when working with
conjunctions and we hope to investigate the
differences between various solutions.
