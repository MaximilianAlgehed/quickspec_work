\section{Methodology}
There are several qualities by which we measure the performance of our different methods.
The primary qualities are:

\begin{itemize}

    \item Soundness
    \item Completeness
    \item Generality

\end{itemize}

In addition to these concrete qualities the overall efficiency of the different methods are also
taken in to account.
We chose these qualities as they all increase the usefullness
of QuickSpec both as a standalone theory exploration tool
and as a component of other tools.

    \subsection{Soundness}
    If QuickSpec generates unsound conjectures, systems that use QuickSpec
    need to spend resources trying to prove conjectures that are false. 

    \subsection{Completeness}
    As the purpose of using QuickSpec in a theory exploration setting is to discover
    new and interesting lemmas, it is obvious that a more expressive QuickSpec means a more
    complete theory. %some reference on completeness or something...
    Completeness is of interest for the reason pointed out in the first paper on QuickSpec; %QuickSpec 1 paper reference
    missing equations tell the user as much about the systems as the equations which are
    present. For this reason, the higher the degree of completeness the higher the usefullness
    of QuickSpec as a stand-alone tool. 

    \subsection{Generality}
    Without a general method for generating the representation of conditionals
    it is hard to see how the functionality would be usefull in an automated setting.
    Furthermore QuickSpec is meant as a light weight tool, without a general method
    for conditional equations the overhead for the user will be big and the feature
    is unlikely to be utilized.
