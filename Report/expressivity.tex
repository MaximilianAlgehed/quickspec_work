\section{Expressivity}

When looking at the definition in 
section \ref{encodings} it is easy to assume
that function encoding is highly expressive.
One assumption one is tempted to make is that
function encoding can handle conditional equations like\\
$\forall xs : List.\;sorted\;(tail\; xs) \implies insert\;(head\;xs)\;(tail\;xs)=sort\;xs$.
However, as we will see there are several limitations to what function encoding can express.

If we analyze the equation above we find that QuickSpec will indeed not find it
using function encoding as easily as we would have hoped.
\begin{verbatim}
-- Function encoding of sorted lists
whenSorted :: [Integer] -> Bool
whenSorted xs
    | sorted xs = xs
    | otherwise = []

let xs = [2, 2, 1, 3]
sort xs = [1, 2, 2, 3]
insert (head xs) (whenSorted (tail xs)) = [2]
\end{verbatim}
Here we see that function will rule the implication of as false. The approach is
incomplete for these types of equations.

%When given a signature like
%\begin{verbatim}
%-- All elements greater than 0
%greater :: [Integer] -> Bool
%
%-- All elements less than 0 
%lesser :: [Integer] -> Bool
%
%-- A function encoding of greater
%whenGreater :: [Integer] -> [Integer]
%whenGreater xs
%    | greater xs = xs
%    | otherwise  = [1]
%
%-- A function encoding of lesser 
%whenLesser :: [Integer] -> [Integer]
%whenLesser xs
%    | lesser xs = xs
%    | otherwise = [-1]
%\end{verbatim}
%QuickSpec will happily generate equations like
%\begin{verbatim}(whenLesser (whenGreater xs)) = [-1]\end{verbatim}
%which of course translates to the riddiculous\\
%$\forall xs : List\; Integer.\; greater(xs)\wedge lesser(xs)\implies xs = Cons\; -1\; Nil$.
%Which is actually just $\forall xs : List\; Integer.\; False\implies xs = Cons\; -1\; Nil$,
%or put simply $p\vee \neg p$.


%These examples clearly illustrate the need to be explicit about conjunctions
%and mappings of data, it is not something we get for free with function or combined
%encoding. 
%Furthermore we now need to consider the extra overhead that is introduced
%when we have to, for each equation generated in a function or combined
%encoding setting, consider if an equation can actually be rewritten
%as a conditional equation.
