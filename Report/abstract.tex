The theory exploration tool QuickSpec
supports only equational reasoning without
conditional equations. Support for conditional
equations in the related tool HipSpec is limited.
We present a comparison of three ways of working with
conditional equations in QuickSpec.
Our analysis shows that encoding conditions as types
yields the best results and we present an overview of
the challenges of this approach as well as examples
of it's power and limitations.
