\section{Results}\label{results}

In order to compare the performance of the different methods
a set of benchmarks have been established. The benchmarks favour
large signatures to even out the effects of randomness on runtime.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
    \hline
    Benchmark                       & Integer arithmetic & Lists \\ \hline
    TE hand $\mu$                   & xxx                & 10.5s \\ \hline
    TE hand $\sigma^2$              & xxx                & 0.3s  \\ \hline
    TE \texttt{suchThat} $\mu$      & xxx                & 10.5s \\ \hline
    TE \texttt{suchThat} $\sigma^2$ & xxx                & 0.3s  \\ \hline
    FE $\mu$                        & $>$30m             & 22.4s \\ \hline
    FE $\sigma^2$                   & N/A                & 1.2s  \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

At 30 minuites function encoding still had
40 000 equations left to test or prune in the Integer arithmetic benchmark.
