\section{Conclusion}
In this report we have presented two 
alternative methods for encoding predicates
in the theory exploration tool QuickSpec.
When considering the relative strengths and weaknesses
of these two methods. We found that function encoding has
some fundamental problems in that there are no clear
semantics for interperting equations which function encodings.
Furthermore function encoding sufffers probmens with efficiency,
as can be seen in section \ref{results} it is far slower
than hand crafted type encoding. The reason for this is that 
function encoding produces a set of laws that use the predicate
functions but can't be read as conditional equations.
For this reason we argued that type encoding is surperior
to function encoding. We proceded to show how function encoding
can handle several situations like domain specific languages
as well as many commonly discussed lemmas in the theory
of lists. Finally we present some of the areas in which
type encoding struggles to provide stable and efficient results.
These areas are primarily the study of injective functions
and conjunctions of predicates. We present suggested novel
solutions to these problems and note that they are future work.
