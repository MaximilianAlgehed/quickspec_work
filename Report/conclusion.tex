\section{Conclusion}
In this report we have presented three
alternative methods for encoding predicates
in the theory exploration tool QuickSpec.
When considering the relative strengths and weaknesses
of these three models we considered combined and function
encoding as more or less one and the same due to their
striking similarities. We found that function encoding has
some fundamental problems in that there are no clear
semantics for interperting equations which function encodings.
For this reason we argue that type encoding is surperior
to function encoding. We proceded to show how function encoding
can handle several situations like domain specific languages
as well as many commonly discussed lemmas in the theory
of lists. Finally we present some of the areas in which
type encoding struggles to provide stable and efficient results.
These areas are primarily the study of injective functions
and conjunctions of predicates. We present suggested novel
solutions to these problems and note that they are future work.
